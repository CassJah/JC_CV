      <p>
        I’m a Full Stack Developer and Cloud Engineer student with experience in
        building responsive web applications, cloud solutions, and deploying
        scalable systems. While I’m relatively new to software development, I
        bring a strong background as a business owner of Chillboarders Aotearoa
        and over 15 years of experience in the geotechnical engineering
        industry. My diverse experience gives me a unique perspective in
        applying tech solutions to real-world problems. I’m skilled in both
        frontend and backend technologies, including React.js, Node.js, and
        cloud platforms such as Azure. I’m excited to leverage my technical skills
        and industry knowledge to create innovative solutions that drive
        business growth and efficiency.
